== Base package scan example

This example will scan for custom `CamelConfiguration` classes that
can be located in other JARs. To use as configuration during bootstrap.

In this example the `custom.jar` is a regular maven dependency defined in `pom.xml`.
The custom JAR includes a `CamelConfiguration` that is triggered on startup,
that creates the `beerProcessor` that are used in the Camel route.
