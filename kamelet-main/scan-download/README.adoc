== Base package scan download example

This example will scan for custom `CamelConfiguration` classes that
can be located in other JARs. To use as configuration during bootstrap.

In this example the `custom.jar` is defined as a dependency in a custom
Kamelet (`custom-beer-source.kamelet.yaml`) which is downloaded automatic
by Camel. After the download the JAR is scanned for `CamelConfiguration` classes,
to be invoked. The configuration creates the `beerProcessor` that are used in the Kamelet.
